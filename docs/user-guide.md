# User Guide

ACCORD is a collaboration across the public universities of Virginia to build and share cyberinfrastructure for research on highly sensitive data. Made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation, ACCORD attempts to provide a service for institutions that may lack the financial, staffing, or technical resources to support such a platform. This project strives to be a repeatable model for other institutions across the United States.
