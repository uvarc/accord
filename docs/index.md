# ACCORD

University of Virginia Research Computing has developed ACCORD (Assuring Controls Compliance of Research Data), a web-based platform to analyze and store secure data including HIPAA, FERPA, and other less-restrictive data. ACCORD is a free service and is project-based, meaning investigators request access to the platform, invite co-investigators, import data, and then use application based computing environments to perform their computational research. Currently, the platform supports RStudio, JupyterLab, and Theia Python, however other applications will be added soon.
