# ACCORD

UVA Research Computing has developed ACCORD (Assuring Controls Compliance of Research Data), a web-based platform to analyze and store secure data including HIPAA, FERPA, and other less-restrictive data. ACCORD is a free service and is project-based, meaning investigators request access to the platform, invite co-investigators, import data, and then use application based computing environments to perform their computational research. Currently, the platform supports RStudio, JupyterLab, and Theia Python, however other applications will be added soon. 

## How to access ACCORD


To preview the ACCORD platform, all you need is a browser. 


[Open ACCORD Console](https://accord.uvarc.io/){: .btn .btn-green}


## How do I use it?

All UVARC team members have been put into two test projects, `uvarc` and `vogons`.

1. SIGN IN to the ACCORD console.
2. Select a PROJECT.
3. Select your ENVIRONMENT: RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks, or Theia Python and click "Start".
4. Wait a few seconds for your environment to provision. Then click CONNECT to enter the environment.
