## What is it

ACCORD (Assuring Controls Compliance of Research Data) gives researchers from different colleges and universities access to a single high-performance computing system capable of processing and storing sensitive data, such as confidential medical information. This is especially important for schools that lack the financial, staffing, or technical resources for such systems. ACCORD is designed to encourage collaborative research partnerships across institutions by managing the risks associated with sensitive data sharing.

ACCORD is project-based, which means that investigators request access 
to the platform, create a project and populate it with co-investigators, 
import data, and then create and use disposable computing environments 
to perform their computational research.


## Who can use it


This platform is open for approved academic research on highly sensitive data. Researchers from
institutions of higher education across the United States are invited to request access.

ACCORD can meet HIPAA, FERPA, and other less-restrictive data sensitivity requirements. More
restrictive levels, such as CUI, FISMA, PCI cannot be satisfied.


## How do I use it


ACCORD is entirely web-based, which means that all you need is a good, modern 
browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge or Safari. Once your project has been approved, you will use the 
ACCORD Console login and select from one of the applications. Currently we offer RStudio, JupyterLab, and Theia Python.

ACCORD offers no SSH, Terminal, FTP, Remote Desktop, or VNC access.



## Who runs it


The ACCORD project was designed and built by the [Research Computing Group](https://www.rc.virginia.edu) at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), under the coordination of the ACCORD Grant Program Manager
[Tho Nguyen](https://vpit.virginia.edu/tho) and [Ron Hutchins](https://vpit.virginia.edu/), Vice Provost of Academic Technology.
