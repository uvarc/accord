## History of ACCORD


ACCORD is a collaboration across the public universities of Virginia
to build and share cyberinfrastructure for research on highly sensitive 
data. Made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation, 
ACCORD attempts to provide a computing platform for institutions that may lack the 
financial, staffing, or technical resources. This project strives to be a repeatable model for other institutions 
across the United States.

ACCORD is project-based, which means that investigators request access 
to the platform, create a project and populate it with co-investigators, 
import data, and then create and use disposable computing environments 
to perform their computational research.


## Who can use it


This platform is open for approved academic research on highly sensitive data. Researchers from
institutions of higher education across the United States are invited to request access.

ACCORD can meet HIPAA, FERPA, and other less-restrictive data sensitivity requirements. More
restrictive levels, such as CUI, FISMA, PCI cannot be satisfied.


## How do I use it


ACCORD is entirely web-based, which means that all you need is a good, modern 
browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge or Safari. Once your project has been approved, you will use the 
ACCORD Console login and select from one of the applications. Currently we offer RStudio, JupyterLab, and Theia Python.

ACCORD offers no SSH, Terminal, FTP, Remote Desktop, or VNC access.



## Who runs it


The ACCORD project was designed and built by the [Research Computing Group](https://www.rc.virginia.edu) at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), under the coordination of the ACCORD Grant Program Manager
[Tho Nguyen](https://vpit.virginia.edu/tho) and [Ron Hutchins](https://vpit.virginia.edu/), Vice Provost of Academic Technology.
