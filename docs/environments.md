# Runtimes & Limitations


- Computing environments can be used for short-lived, interactive, computing and analysis.
- Environments may also be used for longer, more intensive job runs that may last for hours. 
- For extended runs, you may close your browser tab and return later, if so desired.
- While environments cannot be "paused" their configuration can easily be repeated.
- Environments are bound to 16 cores / 48GB of memory / 1TB of cluster storage.
- Outbound access to the Internet is restricted to package and library mirrors such as pip, PyPi, CPAN, CRAN, etc.
- ACCORD is not a BYOC (Bring Your Own Container) environment, but we welcome your suggestions for additional containers to be considered in the future.
