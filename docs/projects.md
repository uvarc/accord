# Projects

The fundamental organizing unit for your work in ACCORD is a project. Within this platform, a project consists of:

+ *Researchers* - a group of approved collaborators.  
+ *Storage* - import and store data for your project up to 1TB. Data import/export is managed by Globus transfers.  

Most other research computing platforms limit users to a specific computing environment. In the case of ACCORD, the computing environment you use is completely independent of your personnel, data, and storage. This means
that you can create and use a variety of environments depending on your research needs on any given day.


## Researchers

Principal Investigators must enroll in the ACCORD platform and be an approved user. PIs can then manage
adding or removing additional personnel, moving code and data, and overall storage.

Co-investigators must also enroll in the ACCORD platform and gain approval. 
Once co-investigators are onboarded into the platform, PIs can add them
to their project(s).

## Data

Data can be managed using the Globus federated GridFTP platform. The ACCORD DTN (data transfer node) endpoint
address can be found once you sign into the ACCORD Console.

ACCORD user access is non-hierarchical and makes no distinction between various project personnel when granting permissions. 
All project members have equal access to project data, i.e. there is no priviledged user or access for any given project.

## Storage

1TB of storage will be allocated for each project by default. Additional storage can be purchased for a fee.

## Computing Environemts

Environments are web-based platforms created on-demand for you to use with your project.
